**Beautiful presentations built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).**

This Hugo theme/module helps creating beautiful Reveal.js presentations embedded in your existing Hugo-based website.

## Wait...what? hugo-reveal? reveal-hugo?

There is another (awesome) project out there called [reveal-hugo](https://reveal-hugo.dzello.com) made by [@dzello](https://dzello.com/).

It also helps you turning any Hugo-based website into Reveal.js presentations and its front page looks exactly the same (I totally stole that).

I tried that project, before creating this one, but I quickly realized I was looking for something else:
I like embedding presentations into my personal website and reveal-hugo is simply not built that way.

So after a couple hours of playing with reveal-hugo, I created this project: hugo-reveal.
Clever name, right?

**TL;DR**

If you want to create a website only containing presentations, give [reveal-hugo](https://reveal-hugo.dzello.com) a try.

Otherwise, this project might be of better use.
